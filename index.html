My parents' support was my second motivation for dealing with online education. They always supported me with words of encouragement for me to not give up and to continue to adapt to online learning. Without the support of my parents, I may not have the courage or the resolve to face this situation.

 </left><h2><font size="+2">Guidance by the Lecturers</h2>
I could not deny that, when students including me were in a dead end and give up with the online learning situation, the lecturers provided a great deal of guidance. Until today, my lecturers' efforts to ensure that their students have sufficient knowledge. So, they provide a variety of platforms for communicating with students in media sosial. This is what motivates me when I look at their efforts and guidance.
